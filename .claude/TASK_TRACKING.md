---

## Phase 3: Toolbar & Interaction ✅
*Depends on Phase 2 completion - needs base components working*

### 3.1 Toolbar Component
- ✅ **Create iteration-deck-toolbar component** - Agent-Claude (Completed: 2025-08-14 16:50) - Singleton toolbar with navigation controls, auto-created by first deck instance
- ✅ **Implement deck selector dropdown** - Agent-Claude (Completed: 2025-08-14 16:50) - Multi-deck support with label fallback to IDs, only shows when multiple decks present
- ✅ **Add slide navigation controls** - Agent-Claude (Completed: 2025-08-14 16:50) - Previous/Next buttons with state updates and disabled states
- ✅ **Display current slide information** - Agent-Claude (Completed: 2025-08-14 16:50) - Show active deck and slide labels with overflow handling

### 3.2 User Interaction
- ✅ **Implement keyboard shortcuts** - Agent-Claude (Completed: 2025-08-14 16:50) - Ctrl/Cmd + Arrow key navigation with document-level event listening
- ✅ **Add visual feedback system** - Agent-Claude (Completed: 2025-08-14 21:09) - Transient pulsing glow effect with CSS keyframes animation that fades after 2 seconds
- ✅ **Create auto-scroll functionality** - Agent-Claude (Completed: 2025-08-14 21:09) - Smooth scroll to bring selected deck into viewport

---

## Phase 4: Styling & Design System ✅
*Completed with inline styles - Vanilla Extract integration deferred*

### 4.1 Component Styling
- ✅ **Create iteration-deck styling** - Agent-Claude (Completed: 2025-08-14 20:30) - Implemented with inline styles including attention glow effects
- ✅ **Create iteration-deck-slide styling** - Agent-Claude (Completed: 2025-08-14 20:30) - Active/inactive states with smooth transitions
- ✅ **Create iteration-deck-toolbar styling** - Agent-Claude (Completed: 2025-08-14 20:30) - Pill-shaped floating toolbar with glassmorphism design

### 4.2 Design System Implementation
- ✅ **Implement functional styling** - Agent-Claude (Completed: 2025-08-14 20:30) - Blue accent colors, proper spacing, responsive design
- ✅ **Create neutral color palette** - Agent-Claude (Completed: 2025-08-14 20:30) - Gray scale with blue accents for active states
- 🔄 **Add dark/light theme support** - Deferred to future iteration (current design is theme-neutral)
- ✅ **Ensure 44px minimum touch targets** - Agent-Claude (Completed: 2025-08-14 20:30) - All interactive elements meet accessibility requirements

### 4.3 UI/UX Improvements
- 🔵 **Update deck selector to use a styled Select element** - We have a custom dropdown that's okay, but has IxD issues. We can make a <select> element that looks nice to designers, though, so let's pivot to a select.
- 🔵 **Make sure toolbar only shows once** - I see duplicate toolbars showing up in layers underneath the toolbar. Let's ensure only one instance of our toolbar displays.

## Phase 5: Advanced Features 🚧
*Core functionality complete, advanced features in progress*

### 5.1 URL Integration
- 🔵 **Implement URL parameter parsing** - Support ?iteration-deck=id&slide=index
- 🔵 **Add state persistence** - Sync URL with active deck/slide state
- 🔵 **Create shareable URLs** - Enable bookmarkable iteration states

### 5.2 AI-First Features
- ✅ **Add AI prompt metadata tracking** - Agent-Claude (Completed: 2025-08-14 12:00) - Store prompt, notes, and confidence in slide props
- ✅ **Implement confidence scoring** - Agent-Claude (Completed: 2025-08-14 20:30) - Display AI confidence percentage in dev mode with visual indicators
- ✅ **Create presentation mode** - Agent-Claude (Completed: 2025-08-14 20:30) - Production mode hides all dev tools and metadata

## Agent Assignment Strategy 🔵

### Concurrent Phases
- **Phase 1**: Up to 5 agents can work simultaneously on different setup tasks
- **Phase 4**: Up to 3 agents can work on different component styling simultaneously  
- **Phase 6**: Up to 4 agents can work on different testing types simultaneously
- **Phase 7**: Up to 2 agents can work on documentation and distribution simultaneously

### Sequential Dependencies
- Phase 2 → Phase 3 (components needed before toolbar)
- Phases 2-4 → Phase 5 (working styled components needed for advanced features)
- Phases 2-5 → Phase 6 (complete functionality needed for comprehensive testing)

### Critical Path
Foundation Setup → Core Components → Toolbar → Visual Feedback → Testing → Distribution

### Current Status Summary
- **Phases 1-3**: ✅ Complete - Full component functionality with toolbar and interactions
- **Phase 4**: ✅ Complete - Functional styling with inline styles (Vanilla Extract deferred)
- **Phase 5**: 🚧 In Progress - Core AI features complete, URL integration pending
- **Phases 6-7**: 🔵 Not Started - Testing and distribution ready to begin

- 🎯 **Advanced environment detection** - Simplified, reliable dev/prod mode detection
- 🎯 **Rich visual feedback** - Transient attention glow effects with CSS animations
- 🎯 **Complete toolbar system** - Multi-deck support with dropdown and keyboard shortcuts
