- L Blocked
- = Needs Review

---

## Phase 1: Foundation & Configuration <ï¿½
*Parallel execution supported - agents can work on different tasks simultaneously*

### 1.1 Project Setup & Configuration
- ï¿½ **Configure Stencil build system** - Set up stencil.config.ts with proper output targets, testing, and development server
- ï¿½ **Configure Zustand** - Create initial Zustand state store structure
- ï¿½ **Configure Vanilla Extract** - Set up CSS-in-JS tooling for component styling
- ï¿½ **Configure TypeScript strict mode** - Ensure proper tsconfig setup for strict compilation
- ï¿½ **Set up testing infrastructure** - Configure Jest unit tests and Puppeteer e2e testing

### 1.2 Core Architecture
- ï¿½ **Create Zustand store structure** - Implement GlobalDeckState interface with deck management methods
- ï¿½ **Implement environment detection** - Create utility to detect dev vs production mode using Stencil's capabilities
- ï¿½ **Design component lifecycle management** - Plan how components register/unregister with global state

---

## Phase 2: Core Components >ï¿½
*Sequential dependencies - iteration-deck must be completed before iteration-deck-slide*

### 2.1 Base Components
- ï¿½ **Create iteration-deck component** - Main container with @Prop definitions and basic structure
- ï¿½ **Create iteration-deck-slide component** - Individual slide wrapper with label and metadata props
- ï¿½ **Implement slot-based content rendering** - Enable arbitrary HTML content within slides

### 2.2 State Integration
- ï¿½ **Connect components to Zustand store** - Integrate deck registration/unregistration lifecycle
- ï¿½ **Implement slide navigation logic** - Active slide switching based on store state
- ï¿½ **Add production vs development rendering** - Show all slides in dev, first slide only in production

---

## Phase 3: Toolbar & Interaction <ï¿½
*Depends on Phase 2 completion - needs base components working*

### 3.1 Toolbar Component
- ï¿½ **Create iteration-deck-toolbar component** - Singleton toolbar with navigation controls
- ï¿½ **Implement deck selector dropdown** - Multi-deck support with label fallback to IDs
- ï¿½ **Add slide navigation controls** - Previous/Next buttons with state updates
- ï¿½ **Display current slide information** - Show active deck and slide labels

### 3.2 User Interaction
- ï¿½ **Implement keyboard shortcuts** - Ctrl/Cmd + Arrow key navigation
- ï¿½ **Add visual feedback system** - Pulsing glow effect for active deck identification
- ï¿½ **Create auto-scroll functionality** - Bring selected deck into viewport

---

## Phase 4: Styling & Design System <ï¿½
*Parallel execution supported - can work on different component styles simultaneously*

### 4.1 Component Styling
- ï¿½ **Create iteration-deck.css.ts** - Main container styling with Vanilla Extract
- ï¿½ **Create iteration-deck-slide.css.ts** - Slide wrapper styling
- ï¿½ **Create iteration-deck-toolbar.css.ts** - Toolbar styling with pill-shaped design

### 4.2 Design System Implementation
- ï¿½ **Implement 8px grid spacing system** - Define spacing tokens (4px, 8px, 12px, 16px, 24px, 32px, 40px, 48px, 56px, 64px)
- ï¿½ **Create neutral color palette** - Gray scale with semantic variants ('50'-'900')
- ï¿½ **Add dark/light theme support** - Implement prefers-color-scheme detection
- ï¿½ **Ensure 44px minimum touch targets** - Accessibility compliance for interactive elements

---

## Phase 5: Advanced Features ï¿½
*Depends on Phases 2-4 - needs working components with styling*

### 5.1 URL Integration
- ï¿½ **Implement URL parameter parsing** - Support ?iteration-deck=id&slide=index
- ï¿½ **Add state persistence** - Sync URL with active deck/slide state
- ï¿½ **Create shareable URLs** - Enable bookmarkable iteration states

### 5.2 AI-First Features
- ï¿½ **Add AI prompt metadata tracking** - Store and display prompt context for slides
- ï¿½ **Implement confidence scoring** - Display AI generation confidence in dev mode
- ï¿½ **Create presentation mode** - Hide AI metadata for stakeholder presentations

---

## Phase 6: Testing & Validation >ï¿½
*Parallel execution supported - different test types can be worked on simultaneously*

### 6.1 Unit Testing
- ï¿½ **Test iteration-deck component** - Rendering, props, lifecycle using newSpecPage
- ï¿½ **Test iteration-deck-slide component** - Content rendering and metadata
- ï¿½ **Test iteration-deck-toolbar component** - Navigation controls and state updates
- ï¿½ **Test Zustand store integration** - State management and cross-component sync

### 6.2 Integration Testing
- ï¿½ **Test multi-deck scenarios** - Multiple decks on same page
- ï¿½ **Test keyboard shortcuts** - Navigation functionality across decks
- ï¿½ **Test environment detection** - Production vs development behavior
- ï¿½ **Test accessibility compliance** - ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, screen readers

### 6.3 End-to-End Testing
- ï¿½ **Test framework compatibility** - React, Vue, Angular, vanilla HTML integration
- ï¿½ **Test cross-browser support** - Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- ï¿½ **Test URL synchronization** - State persistence across page reloads
- ï¿½ **Test responsive design** - Mobile and desktop layouts

---

## Phase 7: Documentation & Distribution =ï¿½
*Parallel execution supported - different documentation types can be worked on simultaneously*

### 7.1 Documentation
- ï¿½ **Generate component README files** - Auto-generated docs using Stencil
- ï¿½ **Create usage examples** - Framework-specific integration examples
- ï¿½ **Write API documentation** - Complete prop and method documentation
- ï¿½ **Create migration guide** - For users upgrading between versions

### 7.2 Build & Distribution
- ï¿½ **Configure package.json exports** - Proper entry points for different consumption patterns
- ï¿½ **Test distribution builds** - Verify ESM, CommonJS, and UMD outputs
- ï¿½ **Create React wrapper components** - Thin React wrappers for easier React integration
- ï¿½ **Validate NPM package structure** - Ensure proper files, types, and loader exports

---

## Agent Assignment Strategy >

### Concurrent Phases
- **Phase 1**: Up to 5 agents can work simultaneously on different setup tasks
- **Phase 4**: Up to 3 agents can work on different component styling simultaneously  
- **Phase 6**: Up to 4 agents can work on different testing types simultaneously
- **Phase 7**: Up to 2 agents can work on documentation and distribution simultaneously

### Sequential Dependencies
- Phase 2 ï¿½ Phase 3 (components needed before toolbar)
- Phases 2-4 ï¿½ Phase 5 (working styled components needed for advanced features)
- Phases 2-5 ï¿½ Phase 6 (complete functionality needed for comprehensive testing)

### Critical Path
Foundation Setup ï¿½ Core Components ï¿½ Toolbar ï¿½ Testing ï¿½ Distribution

## Task Update Protocol =ï¿½

**When starting a task:** Change status from ï¿½ to =ï¿½ and add your name/agent ID
**When completing a task:** Change status from =ï¿½ to  and note completion timestamp  
**When blocked:** Change status to L and document the blocker
**When needs review:** Change status to = and specify what needs review

Example:
```
- =ï¿½ **Configure Stencil build system** - Agent-1 (Started: 2024-01-15 10:30)
-  **Install and configure Zustand** - Agent-2 (Completed: 2024-01-15 11:45)
- L **Configure TypeScript strict mode** - Agent-3 (Blocked: Missing dependency configuration)
```
