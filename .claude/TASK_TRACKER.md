# Task Tracker

Use this file to keep track of tasks as you work.

Remember to follow instructions in @../CLAUDE.md and @.TECHNICAL_SPEC.md

- Once you start a task, mark it as in progress
- If you get blocked and need to change tasks, update the task and mark it as blocked, with a reason for the blocker
- When you complete the task, mark it as complete

## Task Format
```
ðŸ“‹ Example To Do Task - Brief description
ðŸš§ Example In Progress Task - What's currently being worked on
ðŸš« Example Blocked task - Reason for blocking
âœ… Example Completed task - What was accomplished
```

## Project Status

âœ… **Core iteration-deck library is complete and ready for use**

All phases (1-7) of the initial build plan have been completed:
- Lit web components with @vanilla-extract/css styling
- React wrapper components with Zustand integration
- Comprehensive test suite
- Production build system with TypeScript declarations
- Example application demonstrating all features

## Adding New Tasks

When adding new tasks or features:

1. **Use TodoWrite tool** to track progress during work
2. **Add tasks here** for persistent tracking across sessions
3. **Mark as âœ… completed** when fully implemented and tested
4. **Reference related files** in task descriptions (e.g., "Update @src/lit/iteration-deck.ts")

## Current Tasks

_No active tasks - add new features or improvements as needed_
