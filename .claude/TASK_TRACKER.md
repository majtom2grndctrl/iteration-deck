# Task Tracker

Use this file to keep track of tasks as you work.

Remember to follow instructions in @../CLAUDE.md and @.TECHNICAL_SPEC.md

- Once you start a task, mark it as in progress
- If you get blocked and need to change tasks, update the task and mark it as blocked, with a reason for the blocker
- When you complete the task, mark it as complete

## Task Format
```
ðŸ“‹ Example To Do Task - Brief description
ðŸš§ Example In Progress Task - What's currently being worked on
ðŸš« Example Blocked task - Reason for blocking
âœ… Example Completed task - What was accomplished
```

# Current Tasks

*No active tasks. Add tasks here as they are identified or requested by the user.*

## Task Guidelines

### Using Task Tool for Specialized Work
- **design-system-engineer**: CSS styling, design tokens, visual design systems, @vanilla-extract/css work
- **lit-component-engineer**: Lit web components, @vanilla-extract/css styling, Zustand integration
- **react-wrapper-engineer**: React wrapper components, hooks, context patterns
- **unit-test-specialist**: Unit tests for components and utilities
- **accessibility-auditor**: ARIA attributes, semantic HTML, WCAG compliance
- **npm-library-packager**: Package exports, build configuration, distribution

### Concurrent Execution Strategy
- Launch multiple specialized agents simultaneously for different components
- Each agent focuses on one specific component or area
- Parallel execution maximizes efficiency for multi-component tasks
