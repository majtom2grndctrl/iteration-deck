# Task Tracker

Use this file to keep track of tasks as you work.

Remember to follow instructions in @../CLAUDE.md and @.TECHNICAL_SPEC.md

- Once you start a task, mark it as in progress
- If you get blocked and need to change tasks, update the task and mark it as blocked, with a reason for the blocker
- When you complete the task, market it as complete

## Task Format
```
ðŸ“‹ Example To Do Take - Brief description
ðŸš§ Example In Progress Task - What's currently being worked on
ðŸš« Example Blocked task - Reason for blocking
âœ… Example Completed task - What was accomplished

# Current Tasks

## Phase 1: Style System Refactoring (Using Task Tool for Component-Specific Agents)

ðŸ“‹ **[Task Tool - design-system-engineer]** Refactor IterationDeck component styling - Remove @vanilla-extract/css imports, implement CSS tagged template literals with design tokens from src/util/tokens/, use CSS custom properties for runtime-dynamic values (theme switching), ensure ShadowDOM encapsulation, maintain existing visual design and functionality

ðŸ“‹ **[Task Tool - design-system-engineer]** Refactor IterationDeckSlide component styling - Remove @vanilla-extract/css imports, implement CSS tagged template literals with design tokens, use CSS custom properties for slide transitions and AI metadata overlays, ensure ShadowDOM encapsulation, maintain slide transitions and visual states

ðŸ“‹ **[Task Tool - design-system-engineer]** Refactor IterationDeckToolbar component styling - Remove @vanilla-extract/css imports, implement CSS tagged template literals with design tokens, use CSS custom properties for toolbar theming and responsive behavior, ensure ShadowDOM encapsulation, maintain pill-shaped design and backdrop effects

ðŸ“‹ **[Task Tool - design-system-engineer]** Update design tokens system - Refactor existing token files in src/util/tokens/ to remove @vanilla-extract/css dependencies, ensure tokens are pure TypeScript constants for static values, verify compatibility with Lit CSS tagged template literals

ðŸ“‹ **[Task Tool - npm-library-packager]** Remove @vanilla-extract dependencies - Clean up package.json, vite.config.ts, and any remaining @vanilla-extract/css imports throughout the codebase, ensure build system no longer processes CSS at build time

**Concurrent Execution Strategy:**
- Use Task Tool to launch multiple design-system-engineer agents concurrently
- Each agent focuses on ONE component only (IterationDeck, IterationDeckSlide, or IterationDeckToolbar)
- All three component refactoring tasks can run in parallel for maximum efficiency
- Each agent works independently and completes their component refactoring

**Instructions for each design-system-engineer agent:**
- Focus on ONE component only (IterationDeck, IterationDeckSlide, or IterationDeckToolbar)
- Replace all @vanilla-extract/css imports with Lit CSS tagged template literals
- Import design tokens from `../util/tokens/index.js`
- Use TypeScript constants for static values (colors, spacing, typography)
- Use CSS custom properties for runtime-dynamic values (themes, user preferences)
- Ensure all styles are defined within the component's `static styles` property
- Maintain existing visual design and functionality
- Test that ShadowDOM encapsulation works properly
