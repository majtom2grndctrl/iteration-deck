# Task Tracker

Use this file to keep track of tasks as you work.

Remember to follow instructions in @../CLAUDE.md and @.TECHNICAL_SPEC.md

- Once you start a task, mark it as in progress
- If you get blocked and need to change tasks, update the task and mark it as blocked, with a reason for the blocker
- When you complete the task, mark it as complete

## Task Format
```
ðŸ“‹ Example To Do Task - Brief description

# Current Tasks

## PROJECT CONTEXT FOR ALL AGENTS

**What we're building**: Iteration Deck is a web component system for AI-first prototyping that lets designers compare multiple UI variations side-by-side with a slide deck metaphor. Think "duplicate frame" for AI-generated code variations.

**Current state**: 
- âœ… **Pure React implementation** - Complete, fully functional as primary export
- âœ… **Lit web components implementation** - Complete, available at `/wc` export
- âœ… **Single package dual export** - Both implementations working from one package
- âœ… **Shared design system** - Common types and environment detection
- âœ… **Optimized build system** - Clean bundles with proper externalization

**No current tasks.** Replace this line with tasks if tasks are needed.
