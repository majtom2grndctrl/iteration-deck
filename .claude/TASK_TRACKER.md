# Task Tracker

Use this file to keep track of tasks as you work.

Remember to follow instructions in @../CLAUDE.md and @.TECHNICAL_SPEC.md

- Once you start a task, mark it as in progress
- If you get blocked and need to change tasks, update the task and mark it as blocked, with a reason for the blocker
- When you complete the task, market it as complete

## Task Format
```
ðŸ“‹ Example To Do Take - Brief description
ðŸš§ Example In Progress Task - What's currently being worked on
ðŸš« Example Blocked task - Reason for blocking
âœ… Example Completed task - What was accomplished
```

# Build Plan

## Phase 1: Foundation & Dependencies (Sequential - Must be completed first)
âœ… Setup project dependencies - Install Lit, Zustand, @vanilla-extract/css, Vite plugins
âœ… Configure TypeScript - Setup strict mode with experimental decorators for Lit
âœ… Configure Vite build - Library mode, multiple entry points, vanilla-extract plugin
âœ… Setup project structure - Create src/lit, src/react, src/tokens, src/styles, src/core directories

## Phase 2: Core Architecture (Can run concurrently with Task Tool)
âœ… **[Task Tool - general-purpose]** Design tokens system - Create comprehensive token files (colors.ts, spacing.ts, typography.ts, components.ts, animation.ts, zIndex.ts, breakpoints.ts) with central index.ts export - Complete with @vanilla-extract/css integration and theme support
âœ… **[Task Tool - general-purpose]** Zustand store implementation - Create iteration-store.ts with activeDecks state management and environment detection
âœ… **[Task Tool - general-purpose]** Core types and utilities - Framework-agnostic TypeScript interfaces and helper functions implemented in src/core/types.ts and src/core/utilities.ts with comprehensive interfaces for IterationDeck/IterationDeckSlide, environment detection, ID generation, slide navigation, URL state management, keyboard shortcuts, validation, and debugging utilities

## Phase 3: Lit Components (Can run concurrently with Task Tool)
âœ… **[Task Tool - general-purpose]** IterationDeck Lit component - Main container with Zustand integration, slot-based children, environment detection - Complete with comprehensive slot-based architecture, store integration, environment detection, slide navigation API, and proper lifecycle management
âœ… **[Task Tool - general-purpose]** IterationDeckSlide Lit component - Individual slide wrapper with @property decorators - Complete with AI-first prototyping features, accessibility, store integration, and smooth transitions
âœ… **[Task Tool - general-purpose]** IterationDeckToolbar Lit component - Singleton toolbar with multi-deck dropdown, keyboard shortcuts - Complete implementation with singleton pattern, global keyboard handling, multi-deck dropdown, navigation controls, accessibility features, and automatic mounting/cleanup utilities

## Phase 4: Component Styling (Can run concurrently with Task Tool)
âœ… **[Task Tool - general-purpose]** iteration-deck.css.ts - @vanilla-extract styles with design tokens integration - Complete with comprehensive responsive design, theme variants, accessibility, loading/error states, and RTL support
âœ… **[Task Tool - general-purpose]** iteration-deck-slide.css.ts - Slide-specific styling with transitions - Complete with comprehensive @vanilla-extract styles, AI metadata overlays, confidence indicators, accessibility features, and smooth state transitions
âœ… **[Task Tool - general-purpose]** iteration-deck-toolbar.css.ts - Pill-shaped toolbar with backdrop effects, responsive design - Complete with full pill-shaped design, multi-deck dropdown, navigation controls, keyboard shortcuts, and dark mode support

## ~~Phase 5: React Integration (Sequential - Depends on Lit components)~~ Deferred for later
ðŸ“‹ React wrapper for IterationDeck - Manual wrapper with Zustand hook integration
ðŸ“‹ React wrapper for IterationDeckSlide - Proper TypeScript props and children handling
âœ… React hooks setup - useIterationStore hook for React components

## Phase 6: Testing & Documentation (Can run concurrently with Task Tool)
âœ… **[Task Tool - general-purpose]** Unit tests for Lit components - Complete comprehensive test suite with Vitest setup, test utilities, environment mocking, component rendering, accessibility testing, error states, edge cases, public API validation, store integration, lifecycle management, and singleton pattern testing. Includes 25+ passing test cases covering all core functionality.
~~ðŸ“‹ **[Task Tool - general-purpose]** Integration tests for React wrappers - Test React-Lit interop and state synchronization~~
âœ… **[Task Tool - general-purpose]** Example application - Demo showing multiple decks, various usage patterns - Complete comprehensive demo with user preferences form (3 layouts), budgeting dashboard (3 approaches), and contacts list (3 presentation styles). Includes Tailwind CSS from CDN, proper component imports, realistic interactive content, keyboard shortcuts, debug utilities, and full development experience showcase

## Phase 7: Build System & Distribution (Sequential - Final phase)
ðŸ“‹ Production build configuration - Optimize bundles, tree-shaking, code splitting
ðŸ“‹ Package.json setup - Export maps for different frameworks, proper entry points
ðŸ“‹ TypeScript declarations - Ensure proper .d.ts files for all components

## Concurrent Execution Strategy

**Use Task Tool for these parallel work streams:**
- Design tokens can be built independently by one agent
- Each Lit component can be developed by separate agents once tokens/store are ready
- Component styling can be done in parallel once design tokens exist
- Testing can begin as soon as components are implemented

**Sequential Dependencies:**
1. Phase 1 must complete before anything else
2. Zustand store must be ready before Lit components
3. Design tokens must be ready before component styling
4. Lit components must be ready before React wrappers
5. All components must be ready before final build configuration

**Estimated Timeline:**
- Phase 1: 1-2 hours
- Phases 2-4: 4-6 hours (concurrent execution)
- Phase 5: 2-3 hours
- Phase 6: 3-4 hours (concurrent with Phase 5)
- Phase 7: 1-2 hours

**Total Estimated Time: 11-17 hours** (with concurrent execution reducing from ~20+ hours sequential)
